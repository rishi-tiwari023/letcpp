        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day. On the first
                day (Monday), he puts in $1. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he puts in $1 more than the day before.
                On every subsequent Monday, he puts in $1 more than the previous Monday. Given n, return the total
                amount
                of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: n = 4 → Output: 10. After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
                Input: n = 10 → Output: 37. After the 10th day, the total is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7) + (2+3+4) = 37.
                Input: n = 20 → Output: 96. After the 20th day, the total is 96.
