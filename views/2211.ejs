        <h1>LeetCode 2211: Count Collisions on a Road (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                There are n cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from 0 to n - 1 from left to right
                and
                each car is present at a unique point. You are given a 0-indexed string directions of length n.
                directions[i]
                can be either 'L', 'R', or 'S' denoting whether the ith car is moving left, right, or staying at its
                current
                point respectively. Each car moves at the same speed. The number of collisions can be determined by
                observing that cars on the leftmost edge moving left will never collide, and cars on the rightmost edge
                moving right will never collide. All other moving cars will eventually collide with something.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: directions = "RLRSLL" → Output: 5. Cars moving R or L in the middle section will collide.
                Input: directions = "LLRR" → Output: 0. Left cars move left, right cars move right, no collisions.
                Input: directions = "SSRSSRLLRSLLRSRSSRLRRRRLLRRLSSRR" → Output: 20.
