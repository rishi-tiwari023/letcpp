        <h1>LeetCode 3516: Find Closest Person (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given three integers x, y, and z, representing the positions of three people on a number line. x is the position of Person 1, y is the position of Person 2, and z is the position of Person 3 (who does not move). Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed. Determine which person reaches Person 3 first: Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first, Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first, Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: x = 2, y = 7, z = 4 → Output: 1. Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2 steps. Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps. Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.

        int distanceFromPerson2 = abs(y - z);
        
        // Compare distances to determine who arrives first
