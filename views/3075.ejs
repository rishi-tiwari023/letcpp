        <h1>LeetCode 3075: Maximize Happiness of Selected Children (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given an array happiness of length n, and a positive integer k. There are n children standing in
                a
                queue, where the ith child has happiness value happiness[i]. You want to select k children from these n
                children in k turns. In each turn, when you select a child, the happiness value of all the children that
                have
                not been selected till now decreases by 1. Note that the happiness value cannot become negative and gets
                decremented only if it is positive. Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of the selected
                children
                you can achieve by selecting k children.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: happiness = [1,2,3], k = 2 → Output: 4. Select child 3 (happiness 3), then child 2 (happiness now
                1
                after decrement). Total = 3 + 1 = 4.
                Input: happiness = [1,1,1,1], k = 2 → Output: 1. Select first child (1), then second child (0 after
                decrement).
                Total = 1 + 0 = 1.
                Input: happiness = [2,3,4,5], k = 1 → Output: 5. Select the happiest child with value 5.
