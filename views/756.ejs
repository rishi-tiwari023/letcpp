        <h1>LeetCode 756: Pyramid Transition Matrix (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single
                letter.
                Each row of blocks contains one fewer block than the row beneath it and is centered on top. To make the
                pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A
                triangular
                pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of
                three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right
                bottom
                blocks respectively, and the third character represents the top block. Return true if you can build the
                pyramid all the way to the top, and false otherwise.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCC","CDE","CEA","FFF"] → Output: true. We can build: BCD → CE → E.
                Input: bottom = "AAAA", allowed = ["AAB","AAC","BCD","BBE","DEF"] → Output: false. Cannot build complete
                pyramid.
            </p>
