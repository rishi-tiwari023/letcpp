        <h1>LeetCode 3228: Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given a binary string s. You can perform the following operation on the string any number of
                times:
                Choose any index i from the string where i + 1 < s.length such that s[i]=='1' and s[i + 1]=='0' . Move
                    the character s[i] to the right until it reaches the end of the string or another '1' . Return the
                    maximum number of operations that you can perform. </p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                        Input: s = "1001101" → Output: 4. We can perform 4 operations by moving '1's past '0's to reach
                        the end.
                        Input: s = "00111" → Output: 0. All '1's are already at the end, so no operations are needed.
                        Input: s = "1100" → Output: 2. The two '1's can each be moved past the '0's, giving 2 operations
                        total.
                    </p>

                // 2) The next character is '1'
                //
                // This means this '0' acts like a boundary or closing point
