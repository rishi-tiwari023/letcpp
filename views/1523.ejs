        <h1>LeetCode 1523: Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                Given two non-negative integers low and high, return the count of odd numbers between low and high
                (inclusive).
                An odd number is an integer that is not divisible by 2. This straightforward solution iterates through
                all
                numbers in the range and counts those that are odd. Note: For large ranges, a mathematical formula would
                be
                more efficient: count = (high - low) / 2 + 1 if both are odd, or (high - low + 1) / 2 in general.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: low = 3, high = 7 → Output: 3. The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7], so count is 3.
                Input: low = 8, high = 10 → Output: 1. The only odd number in this range is 9.
                Input: low = 1, high = 10 → Output: 5. The odd numbers are [1,3,5,7,9].
