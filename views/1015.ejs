        <h1>LeetCode 1015: Smallest Integer Divisible by K (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n
                is
                divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1. Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return
                -1.
                Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer. A repunit is a number consisting only of 1's (like 1,
                11,
                111, 1111, etc.).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: k = 1 → Output: 1. The smallest repunit divisible by 1 is "1" with length 1.
                Input: k = 2 → Output: -1. No repunit is divisible by 2 (all repunits are odd).
                Input: k = 3 → Output: 3. The smallest repunit divisible by 3 is "111" with length 3.
                Input: k = 7 → Output: 6. The smallest repunit divisible by 7 is "111111" with length 6.
