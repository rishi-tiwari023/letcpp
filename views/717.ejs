        <h1>LeetCode 717: 1-bit and 2-bit Characters (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                We have two special characters: The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second
                character
                can be represented by two bits (10 or 11). Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if
                the
                last character must be a one-bit character. In other words, determine if the last 0 in the array
                represents
                a standalone 1-bit character rather than being part of a 2-bit character.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: bits = [1,0,0] → Output: true. The parsing is "10" (2-bit) + "0" (1-bit), so last character is
                1-bit.
                Input: bits = [1,1,1,0] → Output: false. The parsing is "11" (2-bit) + "10" (2-bit), so last 0 is part
                of
                a 2-bit character.
                Input: bits = [1,0,1,0] → Output: true. Parsing: "10" + "10", but we stop before the last 0, which
                stands alone.
