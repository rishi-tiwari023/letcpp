        <h1>LeetCode 2483: Minimum Penalty for a Shop (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting
                only
                of characters 'N' and 'Y': if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
                whereas
                'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour. If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <=n),
                    the penalty is calculated as: for every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the
                    penalty increases by 1. For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty
                    increases by 1. Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum
                    penalty. The key insight is to track a running balance where 'N' adds +1 and 'Y' adds -1, finding
                    the index with the minimum cumulative value. </p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                        Input: customers = "YYNY" → Output: 2. Close at hour 2: penalty for open hours 0,1 = 0, penalty
                        for closed
                        hours 2,3 = 1. Total penalty = 1.
                        Input: customers = "NNNNN" → Output: 0. Close immediately to avoid all penalties from 'N' hours.
                        Input: customers = "YYYY" → Output: 4. Stay open all hours to serve all customers, close at end.
                    </p>
