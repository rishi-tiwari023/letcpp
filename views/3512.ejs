        <h1>LeetCode 3512: Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. In one operation, you can decrease any element of
                nums by 1. Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of all elements in nums
                divisible
                by k. Since we can only decrease elements, we need to reduce the total sum by exactly (sum % k) to make
                it
                divisible by k.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 6 → Output: 3. The sum is 15, and 15 % 6 = 3. We need 3 operations to
                reduce
                the sum to 12, which is divisible by 6.
                Input: nums = [10,20,30], k = 7 → Output: 4. The sum is 60, and 60 % 7 = 4. We need 4 operations.
                Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 5 → Output: 0. The sum is 15, which is already divisible by 5.
