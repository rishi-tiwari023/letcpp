        <h1>LeetCode 1266: Minimum Time Visiting All Points (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [x_i, y_i]. Return the minimum
                time
                in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points. You can move according to these rules:
                In
                1 second, you can either move vertically by one unit, move horizontally by one unit, or move diagonally
                (one unit vertically and one unit horizontally simultaneously). You must visit the points in the same
                order
                as they appear in the array. The key insight is that the minimum time between two points is the
                Chebyshev
                distance: max(|x2-x1|, |y2-y1|), which can be decomposed into diagonal moves (covering both x and y)
                plus
                remaining straight moves.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]] → Output: 7. Path: [1,1] to [3,4] takes max(2,3)=3 seconds. [3,4]
                to
                [-1,0] takes max(4,4)=4 seconds. Total = 7.
                Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]] → Output: 5. Distance is max(5,0) = 5 seconds.
