        <h1>LeetCode 2011: Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X: ++X and X++ increments the
                value of the variable X by 1. --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1. Initially, the
                value of X is 0. Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final
                value of X after performing all the operations.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"] → Output: 1. Initially X = 0. --X: X becomes -1. X++: X becomes
                0. X++: X becomes 1. Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"] → Output: 3. Initially X = 0. ++X: X
                becomes 1. ++X: X becomes 2. X++: X becomes 3. Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"] → Output:
                0. X increments twice and decrements twice, resulting in 0.
