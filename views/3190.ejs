        <h1>LeetCode 3190: Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of
                nums.
                Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3. Since each element
                can be made divisible by 3 with at most one operation (either adding or subtracting 1 if it's not
                already
                divisible), we simply count how many elements are not divisible by 3.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] → Output: 3. Elements 1, 2, and 4 are not divisible by 3, so we need 3
                operations.
                Input: nums = [3,6,9] → Output: 0. All elements are already divisible by 3.
                Input: nums = [1,2,4,5] → Output: 4. All four elements need one operation each to become divisible by 3.
            </p>
