        <h1>LeetCode 1518: Water Bottles (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty
                water bottles from the market with one full water bottle. The operation of drinking a full water bottle
                turns it into an empty bottle. Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum
                number of water bottles you can drink.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3 → Output: 13. You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full
                water bottle. Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange
                = 4 → Output: 19. You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.

        while (numBottles &gt;= numExchange) {
            // Exchange reduces empty bottles by (numExchange - 1)
            // because we trade numExchange empties for 1 full bottle
