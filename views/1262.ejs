        <h1>LeetCode 1262: Greatest Sum Divisible by Three (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is
                divisible by three. Since we want the sum to be divisible by 3, we track the best sums for each possible
                remainder (0, 1, 2) when divided by 3. For each element, we update these states by considering whether
                to
                include the element or not.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8] → Output: 18. Pick numbers 3, 6, 1, and 8. Their sum is 18 which is divisible
                by 3.
                Input: nums = [4] → Output: 0. Since 4 is not divisible by 3 and we can't form a divisible sum, return
                0.
                Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4] → Output: 12. Pick 3, 4, 4, and 1. Sum = 12, which is divisible by 3.
