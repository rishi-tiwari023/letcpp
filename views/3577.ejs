        <h1>LeetCode 3577: Count the Number of Computer Unlocking Permutations (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given an array complexity where complexity[i] represents the complexity of unlocking the ith
                computer.
                A valid unlocking permutation must start with computer 0 (the first computer), and computer 0 must have
                strictly lower complexity than all other computers. If this condition is not met, return 0. Otherwise,
                return
                the number of valid permutations modulo 10^9 + 7. Since computer 0 must be first, we only permute the
                remaining n-1 computers, giving us (n-1)! valid permutations.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: complexity = [1,2,3,4] → Output: 6. Computer 0 has complexity 1, which is less than all others.
                The remaining 3 computers can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.
                Input: complexity = [5,3,4,2] → Output: 0. Computer 0 has complexity 5, but computer 3 has complexity 2,
                which violates the condition.
                Input: complexity = [1,5,10] → Output: 2. Valid permutations: [0,1,2] and [0,2,1], giving 2! = 2.
