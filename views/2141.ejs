        <h1>LeetCode 2141: Maximum Running Time of N Computers (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You have n computers. You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed integer array batteries where the ith
                battery can run a computer for batteries[i] minutes. You may use each battery to power any computer, and
                you can move batteries between computers. Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all n
                computers
                simultaneously. Note that you can use batteries multiple times by swapping them between computers, but
                each
                battery can only power one computer at a time.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3] → Output: 4. Initially, insert battery 0 in computer 0 and battery 1
                in
                computer 1. After 2 minutes, remove both batteries and insert battery 2 in computer 0 and battery 0 in
                computer 1. After 2 more minutes, both computers run for a total of 4 minutes.
                Input: n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1] → Output: 2. Total power is 4, so we can run 2 computers for 2
                minutes.
