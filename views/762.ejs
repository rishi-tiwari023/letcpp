        <h1>LeetCode 762: Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right]
                having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation. A set bit is a bit in the binary
                representation of a number that has a value of 1. Recall that a number is prime if it has exactly two
                divisors: 1 and itself.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: left = 6, right = 10<br>
                Output: 4<br>
                Explanation: 6 (110) has 2 set bits, 7 (111) has 3, 8 (1000) has 1, 9 (1001) has 2, 10 (1010) has 2.
                Numbers with prime set bits: 6, 7, 9, 10 = 4 numbers.
            </p>
