        <h1>LeetCode 712: Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings
                equal.
                The solution uses dynamic programming where dp[i][j] represents the minimum ASCII delete sum to make
                s1[i..] and s2[j..] equal. When characters match, we don't need to delete anything and move to the next
                position. When they differ, we try deleting from either string and take the minimum cost. The base cases
                handle when one string is exhausted - we must delete all remaining characters from the other string.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat" → Output: 231. Delete 's' from "sea" (cost 115) and 't' from "eat" (cost
                116).
                Total = 231.
                Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet" → Output: 403. Delete 'd' (100) and 'e' (101) from "delete", and 'e'
                (101)
                and 't' (116) from "leet". But optimal path gives 403.
