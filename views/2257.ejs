        <h1>LeetCode 2257: Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid (C++)</h1>
        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D
                integer
                arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [row_i, col_i] and walls[j] = [row_j, col_j] represent the
                positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively. A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal
                directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or
                another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it. Return the number of
                unoccupied cells that are not guarded.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]] → Output: 7. The guarded
                and unguarded cells are shown in the grid. There are 7 unguarded cells.
                Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]] → Output: 4. The guard at
                position [1,1] can see all cells except the 4 corner cells which are blocked by walls.
